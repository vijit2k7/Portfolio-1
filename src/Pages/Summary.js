          <p>
            From the beginning of my journey as a designer & developer, I've
            always been drawn to the overlap between design and development. My
            skills are broad, ranging from working with <b> UX </b> to
            <b> UI </b>, and from <b> front-end </b>
            to <b> back-end </b>development. I love the different aspects of
            working with these technologies, & truly enjoy building products
            from start to finish for clients all over the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've done remote work for business owners, consulted for start-ups,
            and produced digital products for both business and consumer use. My
            love for building products propels me to continue work hard and
            improve my chops.
